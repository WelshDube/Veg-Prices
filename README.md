Vegetable Prices Analysis and Forecasting
Project Overview
This project explores historical vegetable price data from India, aiming to analyze price fluctuations and forecast future prices. By examining trends over time, the analysis provides insights into how seasonal changes, supply chain issues, and market demands impact vegetable prices. The project also seeks to develop predictive models that can assist stakeholders, including farmers and vendors, in making informed decisions.

Dataset
The dataset includes price data for various vegetables like brinjal, tomato, onion, etc., along with corresponding dates. It contains details on price trends across different time periods, which are crucial for understanding market behavior.
